# Microsoft Codefundo Disaster Prediction App

## A mini app to help people in the aftermath of a disaster.

### Current Situation

'''
In case of a disaster, the first hour is crucial. The actions taken in the first hour greatly increases the chances of survival in the aftermath. Citizens usually come to know about the incoming diaster via sirens (present near beaches, public places etc.), news, social networking etc., but often, from the disaster itself.
'''

### Proposed Solution

'''
1. In case of earthquake (floods generated by an earthquake ex. Tsunami)
	- Seismographs works 24*7. The moment a record is made above a certain threshold a notification can be broadcasted. 
2. In case of a climate related diaster (cyclone, typhoon, floods etc.)
	- If the change in climate is above a certain threshold change, notifications can be raised.
