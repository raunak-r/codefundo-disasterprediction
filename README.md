# Microsoft Codefundo Disaster Prediction App

## A mini app to help people right from the moment a disaster occurs.

### Current Situation

```
In case of a disaster, the first hour is crucial. The actions taken in the first hour  
greatly increases the chances of survival in the aftermath. Citizens usually come to  
know about the incoming diaster via sirens (present near beaches, public  
places etc.), news, social networking etc., but often, from the disaster itself.
```

### Proposed Solution

```
1. In case of earthquake (floods generated by an earthquake ex. Tsunami)
	- Seismographs works 24*7. The moment a record is made above a certain  
	threshold a notification can be broadcasted. 
2. In case of a climate related diaster (cyclone, typhoon, floods etc.)
	- If the change in climate is above a certain threshold change,  
	notifications can be raised.

Notification will be sent via SMS, App Notification, Emails.
```

## App Fundamentals 
```
App Statuses -
1. Dormant (The default status of app will be dormant.)
2. Active
3. Aftermath

* Available Internet (i.e. Internet Connection on the phone is switched ON.)
	- A notification will be received by the app which will change status of the app to Active.


* Unavailable Internet (i.e Net connection is neither switched ON nor availaible.)
	- The app will have the permission to read all incoming texts. The moment a SMS, meant for  
	this app is received, they app will move to Active Status.
```

#### Active Stage

```
1. Override Audio Setting and play an emergency sound on full volume. (can be customised to also
	speak the type of disaster.)
2. Override GPS Settings:
	- If Net is on (send current gps location to Family members present in Database.)
	- If Net cannot be accessed (send last gps location)

Additional Tasks Performed - 
1. Each time the GPS is turned on, save location.
```

## The Science of Prediction

```
Machine learning will be employed to identify the threshold values over which notifications will be 
sent to end users.
```

## Possible Challenges
```
If the threshold is too low, end users might get irritated of frequent notifications.
	- The app will only have the option to uninstall, and not switch off disaster notification. 
	(Makes people think twice before uninstalling but not before switching off notifications.)
```

### Further Features of the App
```
1. Introduce feature to keep track of inventory for an user.
	ex. Medicines, Food, Basic Clothes, etc.
	To facilitate a person in keeping track of his disaster bag and replenish when necessary.

2. Introduce OFFLINE Survival Tips n Tricks for an user to access when needed.

3. Integrate social networking in the app to let users disseminate local information, ask for help, update regional news etc.

4. The future is endless. This can be used to directly co-ordinate with government agencies, send last seen
location to rescue teams, point out shelters, clinics etc.
